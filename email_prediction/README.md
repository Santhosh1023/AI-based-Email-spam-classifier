# Email Classifier using Naive Bayes and tkinter GUI

This is a Python application that demonstrates how to build a simple email classifier using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) with tkinter. The classifier is trained on a dataset of emails labeled as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." Users can input a message, and the classifier predicts whether the message is "ham" or "spam."
